1. What are the pros and cons of React?
2. How can compare it with Angular?

Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

React is the library for web and native user interfaces.

It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.
It uses server-side rendering.
It follows uni-directional data flow or data binding.

pros:
It increases the application’s performance
It can be conveniently used on the client as well as server side
Because of JSX, code’s readability increases
React is easy to integrate with other frameworks like Meteor, Angular, etc
Using React, writing UI test cases become extremely easy

React is just a library, not a full-blown framework
Its library is very large and takes time to understand
It can be little difficult for the novice programmers to understand
Coding gets complex as it uses inline templating and JSX
